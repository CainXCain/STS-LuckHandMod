# STS Luck Hand Mod

includes a special relic and a custom mod

start with only a lot of (now 100) curses (now Ascension's Bane only) and that relic

the relic:
- make each unplayable card a change to get a random card
- works like dead branch+blue candle+tungsten rod ( this is the source of its strange name ),but only for curses
- don't interact with other relics like dead branch or blue candle, that means having dead branch gives you 2 random cards each curses, while having blue candle damage still damage you 1 hp each curse
- gives you additional energy and card
- prevent you from getting cards

can't draw so I used the photo of blue candle as the relic image

---

### TODO
- relic image
- more custom options ( type and amount of start curses, additional energy and card amount, cost energy for each curse)

## “现开手牌”模组

灵感来自钨合金棍+蓝蜡烛+枯树枝，做了一个自订模式

开局是100张进阶之灾，加一个让你可以打出诅咒变成随机牌的遗物

遗物让你不能获得卡牌奖励，但给能量和抽牌作为补偿

和上面三个灵感遗物独立，所以玩这个模式不要拿蓝蜡烛（仍会让你掉血，蓝蜡烛是你打出原本不可打出的诅咒就掉血），拿树枝就是一张诅咒变两张随机牌

不会画图，遗物图标用了蓝蜡烛的图

待更新：允许在config改提供的能量、额外抽牌，开局诅咒数量和种类
